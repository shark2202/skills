## What this file is (and is NOT)

This is the **one-time joining flow** for new agents. It tells you how to:

1. Verify the central directory exists
2. Discover where to install the skill in your runtime
3. Install (symlink → copy → readonly fallback)
4. Run a closed-loop trigger test
5. Register your presence
6. Hand off to the runtime skill for daily use
7. Stay current as the protocol evolves (update strategy)

This file is **NOT** the runtime skill. The runtime skill (`~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md`) is the thing your runtime loads to give you ongoing capabilities like reading shared identity, writing daily logs, and handoffs to other agents.

**Distinction matters**: onboarding is an **action you do once** (with periodic re-invocation only on major version bumps). The skill is a **capability you carry forward**. If you re-trigger this onboarding file every session, you'll waste cycles reinstalling things that are already installed. That is not the point.

---

## 🚫 ANTI-PATTERN — DO NOT DO THIS

*Real failure case (2026-05-28):* An agent named **Marvis** received the onboarding instruction. Its real user-extensible skills dir was `~/Library/Application Support/<its-own-bundle-id>/.../User/<uuid>/skills/`. It saw `~/.marvis/` didn't exist, then noticed `~/.workbuddy/skills/` already existed (because WorkBuddy installed there), and **symlinked itself into `~/.workbuddy/skills/agent-commons` — polluting another agent's skill list.**

**Lesson 1 — wrong owner**: never install into a directory that belongs to a different agent. If your `~/.<your-name>/` doesn't exist, that almost always means your skills dir lives elsewhere (Method A/B/C in Step 2), not that you should hijack someone else's home or create a fake one.

**Lesson 2 — wrong tier inside your own runtime**: many agents (Marvis, Cursor, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Desktop, etc.) have **two** skill locations — a built-in/whitelisted one (read-only, signed) and a user-extensible "Custom Skills" one. **Third-party skills like `agent-commons` MUST go into the user-extensible directory.** Installing into the built-in tier silently fails to load — files exist on disk but the runtime never triggers the skill.

**Lesson 3 — install ≠ done**: file on disk is not success. Successful trigger from inside the runtime is success. After installing, you MUST verify the runtime can actually invoke the skill, and walk down the fallback ladder (symlink → copy → readonly) if it cannot.

**Lesson 4 — naive `cp -R` for updates leaves ghost files**: in Tier 2 (copy), running `cp -R src/. dst/` to "update" your snapshot **only adds and overwrites**; it does not delete files that were removed upstream. Over a few protocol releases, your local snapshot accumulates obsolete files contradicting the live protocol. **Always use `rsync --delete` or `Robocopy /MIR`** — see Step 7.

---

## Step 1 — Verify central directory access

```bash
ls ~/.agent-commons/   # POSIX
# or:
Get-ChildItem $env:USERPROFILE\.agent-commons   # Windows PowerShell
```

You must see at least: `identity/  rules/  toolchain/  projects/  log/  handoff/  skills/  registry.json  ONBOARDING.md`

If the directory is missing, the user has not run the installer yet. Tell them:

> "I need you to run the Agent Commons installer first:
>   - macOS/Linux: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dqsjqian/agent-commons/main/install.sh | bash`
>   - Windows: `iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dqsjqian/agent-commons/main/install.ps1 | iex`"

Then stop. Re-run this onboarding after they've installed.

---

## Step 2 — Discover where the skill must go in **your** runtime

> **The directory you want is the one your runtime is allowed to load third-party skills from** — sometimes called "Custom Skills", "User Skills", "Plugins", or "Extensions". Not just any folder named `skills/`.

### Why this matters

Many modern agents ship with two skill locations:

| Tier | Purpose | Writable? | Loadable as your install target? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Built-in / system skills** | Bundled with the app, signed/whitelisted | Often read-only | ❌ No — runtime ignores foreign files here |
| **User-extensible / custom skills** | Where the user / agent installs **third-party** skills | Yes | ✅ Yes — the only legal target |

If you install into the built-in tier:
- `ls` shows the files ✓
- Runtime's skill list **does not include them** ✗
- The user thinks it worked, you think it worked, but `agent-commons` will never actually trigger.

### Discover via Method A → B → C (stop at the first success)

**Method A — Your runtime documents a "custom skills" / "user skills" path. Use that.**
This is the gold standard. Look for terms like "Custom Skills directory", "User Skills folder", "Third-party plugins path", "Extensions folder", an env var (`<AGENT>_SKILLS_DIR`, `<AGENT>_PLUGINS_DIR`), or a settings UI field.

| Agent | Likely user-extensible skills root |
|---|---|
| Claude Code (CLI) | `~/.claude/skills/` (single tier — no whitelist) |
| WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy (CLI) | `~/.workbuddy/skills/` ・ `~/.codebuddy/skills/` |
| Cursor | check Settings → Extensions/Custom path |
| Marvis (macOS app) | the **"Custom Skills"** dir under `~/Library/Application Support/<bundle-id>/.../User/<uuid>/`, **not** the built-in skills folder shipped inside the .app bundle |
| ChatGPT / Claude Desktop | the user plugins/MCP path exposed by Settings |
| Generic CLI agent | `~/.<agent-name>/skills/` |

**Method B — Filesystem probe.** Look for a directory whose path or name signals "user/custom/extension", not "built-in/system":

```bash
# POSIX
find ~ -maxdepth 7 -type d 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -iE "(custom[-_ ]?skills|user[-_ ]?skills|user[-_ ]?plugins|extensions)" \
  | grep -iE "<your-agent-name>" | head -20
```
```powershell
# Windows
Get-ChildItem -Path $env:USERPROFILE,$env:APPDATA,$env:LOCALAPPDATA `
  -Recurse -Depth 6 -Directory -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue `
  | Where-Object { $_.FullName -match "(?i)<your-agent-name>.*(custom|user|plugin|extension)" }
```

If you find both built-in and user/custom dirs under your agent's tree, **always pick the user/custom one**.

**Method C — Ask the user.**
If A and B both fail, ask **once**:
> "I need to install the Agent Commons skill where your runtime can actually load it (the *user-extensible* / *custom skills* directory, not the built-in one). I'm not sure which path that is for me. Could you tell me, or point me at the relevant setting?"

### Hard rules before you write anything

1. **Never install into another agent's directory.**
2. **Never install into a built-in / signed / whitelist-gated skills directory.** It will silently fail to load.
3. **Never `mkdir ~/.<my-name>/skills` if `~/.<my-name>/` doesn't already exist** as your real home.
4. **The central dir `~/.agent-commons/` is shared, not yours.** Don't install the skill *back into* it.
5. **One install per agent.** If a previous valid install already exists, skip to Step 4 (trigger test) to verify it still works, and to Step 5 (register) to update `last_seen`.

Set `SKILLS_ROOT` to the user-extensible directory you discovered. The rest of Step 3 uses it.

---

## Step 3 — Install (symlink → copy → readonly)

### Tier 1 — Symlink (preferred)

```bash
# POSIX:
mkdir -p "$SKILLS_ROOT"
ln -sfn ~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons"
```
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell (needs Developer Mode or Administrator):
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $SKILLS_ROOT -Force | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "$SKILLS_ROOT\agent-commons" `
         -Target "$env:USERPROFILE\.agent-commons\skills\agent-commons" -Force | Out-Null
```

### Tier 2 — Copy (fallback if symlinks fail or your runtime refuses to follow them)

```bash
mkdir -p "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons"
cp -R ~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/. "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons/"
```

You'll need to re-sync on each session start (or on demand). See Step 6 for the update protocol.

### Tier 3 — Read-only (last resort)

If even copy fails (read-only skills dir, fully sandboxed runtime, no FS write), skip the local install. Just `cat ~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md` at every conversation start. You won't appear in your own agent's skill list, but you can still follow the protocol.

---

## Step 4 — Closed-loop trigger test (mandatory: install ≠ done)

> **Do not move on until you've actually triggered the skill in your own runtime — or exhausted all fallbacks and reported the failure honestly.** "Files are on disk" is not success. "I can call this skill in this very session" is success.

### A. File-level sanity (cheap pre-check)

```bash
ls -l "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons/SKILL.md"
readlink "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons" 2>/dev/null
```

If file checks fail → install itself broke. Re-run Step 3.

### B. Trigger-level self-test (the actual proof)

Invoke the skill **in your own runtime**. Use whichever signal your runtime supports:

1. **Skill listing API.** Run your runtime's "list installed skills" / "list custom skills". Confirm `agent-commons` appears.
2. **Description echo.** Many runtimes load the `description:` from the skill's frontmatter on discovery. Trigger discovery, then check whether the runtime's view of `agent-commons` shows the description from `~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md`. If empty / a stub / "unknown" → not loaded.
3. **Live invocation.** Call the skill end-to-end. If your runtime supports a "Skill" / "tool" call that names the skill, that's the gold standard.

Pick the strongest available signal. Document which one you used in your final acknowledgment.

### C. Adaptive fallback ladder (do not give up after one failed attempt)

```
[Tier 1: symlink] ──fails to load──▶ [Tier 2: copy] ──fails to load──▶ [Tier 3: readonly] ──fails──▶ honest report
```

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Symlink installed, runtime's skill list doesn't show `agent-commons` | Runtime sandbox refuses symlink traversal (common on macOS app sandboxes) | Remove symlink, switch to Tier 2 (copy). Retest. |
| Copy installed, still not in skill list | Wrong tier (built-in vs user-extensible) | Roll back, redo Step 2 Method C. Retest. |
| In skill list, description empty / parse error | Manifest format mismatch (your runtime needs different frontmatter) | Build a runtime-specific shim, or drop to Tier 3. |
| Path forbidden by sandbox / SIP / TCC | Runtime can never load files from this directory | Find a different user-extensible path; if none → Tier 3. |
| All three tiers fail | Runtime fundamentally cannot load third-party skills | Honest report (Section D). |

Rollback before retrying:

```bash
# Symlink-only: rm the link, never the target
[ -L "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons" ] && rm "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons"
# Copy: rm the directory you created (only if YOU created it)
[ -d "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons" ] && rm -rf "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons"
```

Each retry: change exactly one variable (tier / target dir / manifest format) so you know which fix worked. Walk the ladder **autonomously** — do not stop and ask the user between steps.

### D. Honest failure report (only after exhausting C)

If symlink → copy → readonly all fail to make the runtime actually trigger the skill, **stop trying and tell the user the truth**. Don't pretend it worked. Use this template:

> "I tried to join Agent Commons but my runtime can't load the skill in a way that I can actually trigger it.
>
> What I tried:
> 1. Symlink at `<path>` → installed, but runtime's skill list didn't show `agent-commons` (likely cause: `<one-line diagnosis>`)
> 2. Copy at `<path>` → `<result + diagnosis>`
> 3. Readonly mode (`cat SKILL.md` each session) → `<result>`
>
> Diagnosis: due to `<specific runtime limitation: sandbox / signed-skills-only / no third-party plugin support / etc.>`, this agent likely cannot fully join Agent Commons.
>
> What still works: I can read files under `~/.agent-commons/` directly during conversations, so the **readonly tier is the practical mode for me**. I'll do that. I won't appear as a registered member in the runtime's skill list, but I can still follow the protocol manually.
>
> If you know a workaround (a 'custom skills' path I missed, a setting to enable third-party plugins, etc.), tell me and I'll retry."

This honest failure is acceptable. Silent fake success is not.

---

## Step 5 — Register your presence

Use **`Edit` (in-place patch)**, NOT `Write` (full overwrite). `~/.agent-commons/registry.json` is shared.

Add or update your entry:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": "2.0",
  "agents": {
    "<your-agent-name>": {
      "joined_at": "<ISO 8601 of first join>",
      "home": "~/.<your-agent-name>/",
      "last_seen": "<ISO 8601 now>",
      "protocol_version": "<the protocol_version you just joined under, copied from ~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/manifest.json>",
      "install_tier": "symlink|copy|readonly",
      "install_verified": "skill_list|description_echo|live_invocation|none",
      "skills_root": "<the actual user-extensible skills dir you installed into>",
      "capabilities": ["read_files", "write_files", "..."]
    }
  }
}
```

The `protocol_version` field on your entry is what the runtime skill uses to detect major version drift (see `skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md` § Self-check). Don't omit it.

If you can't write to registry.json (no FS permission) → log it and proceed. The protocol still works without registry presence; you just won't be visible to other agents' "who's online" queries, and you'll lose the major-version-drift detection.

---

## Step 6 — Hand off to the runtime skill (you're done with onboarding)

Onboarding is a one-time event. **From this turn onward, you do NOT re-read this file** in the normal course of operation. The runtime skill at `~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md` carries all the day-to-day capabilities (reading shared identity, writing daily logs, handoffs).

Your trigger conditions for the runtime skill are different — they're things like "I need the user's identity profile", "I should log this work as cross-agent visible", "I want to hand off to another agent". The runtime skill's frontmatter spells these out.

The only times you SHOULD come back to this onboarding file:

1. After a **major protocol-version bump** (see Step 7 — versioning rules below).
2. If your install gets corrupted (broken symlink, deleted files) and you need to redo Steps 2-5.

---

## Step 6.5 — Where to install / put / use things going forward (recommended convention)

> This is a **lifestyle change**, not a one-time step. From now on, treat `~/.agent-commons/` as your default home for **anything** that should be:
>
> - Shared with other joined agents on this machine
> - Backed up as a unit when the user moves machines
> - Visible to the user as part of their AI-state inventory

The central directory has a **convention layer** of subdirectories that Agent Commons does NOT read or validate. They're there for skills, MCP servers, plugins, and shared tools to use voluntarily — and getting everyone to use the same locations is what gives the user a single, sane backup story.

### The four shared layers

| Layer | Path | What goes here | Who can use it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shared skills** | `~/.agent-commons/skills/<skill-name>/` | Skill packages (SKILL.md + scripts + manifest) that the user wants **available to every joined agent**, not just one | **Any joined agent can load and trigger any skill in this directory.** This is the cross-agent skill bus. |
| **Skill data** | `~/.agent-commons/skills_data/<skill-name>/` | Per-skill persistent data (caches, learned profiles, conversation logs, anything that should survive sessions) | The owning skill writes; others MAY read if the skill documents that |
| **Shared MCP servers** | `~/.agent-commons/mcp/<server-name>/` | MCP server configs or local implementations the user wants **shared across agents** | Any joined agent can wire up to these MCP servers |
| **Shared plugins** | `~/.agent-commons/plugins/<plugin-name>/` | Plugins (browser/editor/IDE extensions, agent-agnostic) | Any agent or tool that knows how to load this plugin format |
| **Shared CLI tools** | `~/.agent-commons/tools/<tool-name>/` | Scripts / utilities the user may run from any shell session | Anyone — agent or human |

### Three rules going forward (memorize these)

1. **When installing a NEW skill / MCP / plugin / tool**: install it under the corresponding convention-layer directory above. Don't drop it under `~/.<some-agent>/` unless that agent's runtime *requires* a private location (rare). Prefer the shared, agent-neutral location.

2. **When USING an existing skill / MCP / plugin / tool**: look in `~/.agent-commons/{skills,mcp,plugins,tools}/` first. If it's there, use that copy. Don't reinstall a private duplicate. **Read from the central location, not from your own home.**

3. **When WRITING persistent data**: route it through `~/.agent-commons/skills_data/<your-skill-name>/` — split into `public/` and `private/` subdirectories if the data has mixed sensitivity (see Privacy layering below).

### Concrete examples

| The user said... | What you should do |
|---|---|
| "Install the wechat-publisher skill" | `git clone` / `cp -R` it into `~/.agent-commons/skills/wechat-publisher/`, then symlink/copy from there into your runtime — same fallback ladder as in Step 3 |
| "Set up the Tencent Lexiang MCP" | Place the MCP config / launcher in `~/.agent-commons/mcp/lexiang/`, point your runtime's MCP config at that path |
| "Save my conversation embeddings" | `~/.agent-commons/skills_data/<your-skill>/embeddings/` (or `private/embeddings/` if sensitive) |
| "Use my soul-archive data" | Read from `~/.agent-commons/skills_data/soul-archive/` if it's there; otherwise fall back to its standalone location |
| "Add a `claw-state` helper script" | Drop it in `~/.agent-commons/tools/claw-state/`, tell the user to add that path to their `$PATH` |

### Why this matters

- **The user backs up `~/.agent-commons/` once → everything moves with them.** All shared skills, MCPs, plugins, tools, and skill data come along on the same rsync.
- **New agents joining the protocol see the same shared data and capabilities** without each one reinventing storage.
- **Data written outside this tree is invisible to other joined agents** and won't follow the user across machines.
- **A user who installs a useful skill once** wants it available to every agent they talk to, not just the one that did the install.

### Privacy layering for mixed-sensitivity data

If a skill writes a mix of shareable + sensitive data, split into clearly named subdirectories so the user can apply different sync policies:

```
~/.agent-commons/skills_data/<skill-name>/
├── public/      ← safe to sync everywhere (preferences, profiles, settings)
├── private/     ← sensitive — recommend .gitignore by default
└── ...
```

See [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) (also at `~/.agent-commons/CONVENTIONS.md`) for the full convention spec.

### When NOT to use these locations

The convention is a default, not a mandate. Keep data outside `~/.agent-commons/` when:

- The data fundamentally belongs in OS-managed locations (keychain, `/var`, `~/Library/Application Support/`, etc.)
- The data should be wiped on logout / shared across users / encrypted at rest by an OS service
- The skill / runtime *requires* a specific path it doesn't control

**This convention is non-normative** — the protocol still works if you ignore this whole step. But adopting it makes the user's life dramatically easier and lets multiple agents collaborate over a shared toolkit.

---

## Step 7 — Update protocol (how to stay current as the central skill evolves)


The central directory `~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/` is the **single source of truth**. As the protocol evolves, files there will be **added, modified, removed, or renamed**. Your local install must stay in sync, or it will silently drift.

How you stay current depends on your install tier:

### Tier 1 — Symlink (zero work)

Your `<SKILLS_ROOT>/agent-commons` points back to `~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/`. Any change in the central dir is **instantly visible** to your runtime. No update step needed. Skip to Step 7.4 (post-update self-test).

### Tier 2 — Copy (you MUST resync; default is broken)

Your `<SKILLS_ROOT>/agent-commons/` is a frozen snapshot. Plain `cp -R src/. dst/` **will not delete files that were removed upstream** — those become "ghost files" that contradict the live protocol. **You must use a mirror operation**, not a plain copy.

#### When to resync

Trigger a resync if **any** of these is true:

- This is the **first invocation in a new session today** (cheap insurance against multi-day drift).
- The user explicitly asked you to update Agent Commons.
- You detect a `protocol_version` mismatch between `~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/manifest.json` and your local snapshot's manifest.
- A `git pull` / installer-rerun happened on the central dir since your last session (timestamp on `~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md` is newer than your snapshot's).

A simple "skip if same hash" check works fine — you don't need a daemon.

#### How to resync (correct mirror semantics)

The operation is **mirror**, not copy. Pick one:

**POSIX — `rsync` with `--delete` (preferred — atomic enough, fast)**

```bash
rsync -a --delete ~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/ "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons/"
# Note the trailing slash on the source — copies CONTENTS, not the dir itself.
# --delete removes any files in dst that no longer exist in src (handles deletions/renames).
```

**POSIX — pure shell fallback (if `rsync` unavailable)**

```bash
# Stage to a temp dir first so a network/disk failure mid-copy doesn't corrupt the live install.
TMP="$(mktemp -d)"
cp -R ~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/. "$TMP/"
# Atomic-ish swap: rm old, mv new. (True atomicity needs same-FS.)
rm -rf "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons"
mv "$TMP" "$SKILLS_ROOT/agent-commons"
```

**Windows PowerShell — `Robocopy /MIR`**

```powershell
robocopy "$env:USERPROFILE\.agent-commons\skills\agent-commons" `
         "$SKILLS_ROOT\agent-commons" /MIR /NJH /NJS /NDL /NFL
# /MIR = mirror: copy adds/changes AND deletes orphans in dst.
```

**Why not plain `cp -R`?**
File added upstream → ✓ copied. File modified upstream → ✓ overwritten. File **deleted** upstream → ✗ still sitting in your snapshot, contradicting truth. File **renamed** upstream → ✗ both old and new names coexist. After a few protocol releases, your local snapshot diverges from the protocol in invisible ways. The mirror operations above all handle adds + modifies + deletes + renames correctly.

**Don't manually patch your snapshot.** Always replace it wholesale via mirror. The central dir is the only source of truth.

### Tier 3 — Read-only (zero work)

Each session you read directly from `~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md`. Always live. No update step.

### 7.4 — Post-update self-test (mandatory, even on Tier 1 / Tier 3)

> **CRITICAL: After any update — including Tier 1's "free" updates — re-run the closed-loop trigger test from Step 4.B.** A protocol update can introduce frontmatter or schema changes your runtime parses differently. "It used to work" is not evidence "it still works".

Specifically:

1. Re-trigger the skill in your runtime.
2. Confirm the runtime's view of `agent-commons` reflects the **new** description / capabilities (description echo). If your runtime caches skill metadata, you may need to reload its skill index.
3. If the trigger test now fails (description empty, skill not listed, invocation errors), **walk down the tier ladder again** as in Step 4.C — symlink → copy → readonly. Don't assume yesterday's working tier still works after a schema change.

If the post-update self-test fails on all tiers, deliver the **Step 4.D honest failure report** to the user, noting that the failure appeared **after** an update.

### 7.5 — Major version bump → full re-onboarding

If you detect that `~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/manifest.json` has a `protocol_version` whose **major** number is higher than what your registry entry recorded at join time (e.g. you joined under `1.x`, central is now `2.0`):

- **A minor or patch bump** (1.0 → 1.1, 1.1 → 1.1.3): just resync per the tier rules above. No re-onboarding needed.
- **A major bump** (1.x → 2.0): the on-disk schema may have changed in incompatible ways. **Re-read this `ONBOARDING.md` from the top and redo Steps 2-5** (your `SKILLS_ROOT` may stay the same; the install operation needs to re-validate against the new schema). After re-onboarding, update your registry entry's `protocol_version` field.

The runtime skill (`skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md`) will detect a major mismatch on each invocation and refuse to operate, redirecting you here. Don't try to soldier on with a stale install.

### 7.6 — Failed update recovery

If an update operation fails partway (network drop, disk full, permission error):

- **Tier 1**: nothing changed (you didn't touch your symlink). Inspect `~/.agent-commons/` manually.
- **Tier 2**: if you used the temp-dir + atomic swap pattern above, your live install is untouched. Retry the update. If you used `rsync --delete` and it failed mid-flight, your snapshot may be in a partial state — **re-run rsync** (it's idempotent) until it completes cleanly, then run the post-update self-test.
- **Tier 3**: nothing to recover; you read live each session.

Rule of thumb: **never** leave the user with a half-updated install + a "looks-like-success" message. If you can't complete cleanly, roll back and report.

---

## Final acknowledgment

After Steps 1-5 are done **and the Step 4 trigger test passed**, tell the user:

> **✅ Joined Agent Commons.**
> tier: `symlink` | `copy` | `readonly` ・ install verified via: `skill_list` | `description_echo` | `live_invocation`
> skills_root: `<path>`
> Registered in registry.json. Going forward I'll trigger the runtime skill (`~/.agent-commons/skills/agent-commons/SKILL.md`) for shared-memory operations.

If you walked the fallback ladder, mention which tier you ended on and why.

If the trigger test ultimately failed → use the **Section D honest report** template instead. **Do not paste this success template if your runtime can't actually trigger the skill.**

---

## Failure modes (read carefully)

If a step fails, KEEP GOING. Don't silently abandon. Report what failed, complete what's possible.

- Step 1 fails (no central dir) → tell user to install, stop.
- Step 2 fails (can't find your own user-extensible skills dir) → ask the user (Method C) **once**, don't fall back to "install somewhere plausible".
- Step 3 installed in another agent's directory → roll back, redo Step 2.
- Step 4 trigger test fails → walk the ladder per Section C. Don't fake success.
- Step 4 ladder fully exhausted → Section D honest report. Readonly is the practical mode going forward.
- Step 5 fails (can't write registry.json) → log it, proceed.

**The only true failure is refusing to read this file, or pretending the install worked when the runtime can't actually trigger the skill.** If you've read this far, you've crossed the threshold.

---

## What's next

Now that you've joined, when you next need cross-agent memory operations:

- Read shared identity / rules / current focus → trigger the runtime skill
- Write a daily log entry → trigger the runtime skill
- Hand off a task to another agent → trigger the runtime skill

The runtime skill knows how. You don't need to come back here.
